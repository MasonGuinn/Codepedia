## Introduction

Codepedia is designed to be a comprehensive resource for developers of all skill levels, providing valuable information and enhancing coding skills.

## Update 4/23/2025
A lot has been changed/added. Newest feature is MUSIC. Simply click the Music icon on the left sidebar, and a Soundcloud playlist (my personal playlist) will open in the side pane. The Music works throughout all your notes, and you can easily pick a song, pause, and etc. Simply add your own playlist in Community Plugins -> Custom Frames -> SoundCloud -> Show Settings -> URL

Oh yeah, added a editing toolbar for easily making new content when you switch to Editing View.
