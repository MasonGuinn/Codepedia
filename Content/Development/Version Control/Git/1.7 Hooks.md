Git hooks are powerful scripts that allow you to automate various tasks during your Git workflow. These hooks are executed automatically at certain points during the Git process, such as before a commit, after a push, or when a merge occurs. By using Git hooks, you can enforce coding standards, run tests, or automate deployment processes, saving time and reducing human error.

In this lesson, we'll explore what Git hooks are, how to use them, and provide examples of useful hooks you can integrate into your workflow.

### What Are Git Hooks?

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur. These events include actions like committing changes, pushing updates, and merging branches. Git hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory within your Git repository. By default, this directory contains sample scripts for common hooks.

There are two main types of Git hooks:

- **Client-side hooks**: These hooks run on your local machine, triggered by actions such as committing, merging, or pushing.
- **Server-side hooks**: These hooks run on the Git server, often used to enforce rules when receiving or pushing changes to a repository.

### Common Git Hooks

Here’s a list of some of the most commonly used Git hooks:

#### 1. **Pre-commit Hook**

The `pre-commit` hook is executed right before a commit is made. It allows you to perform checks, such as ensuring that your code follows a style guide or that there are no syntax errors, before allowing the commit to proceed.

- **Use case**: Linting code, running tests, or checking for large files before commit.
- **Example**: Rejecting commits with files larger than a certain size

`#!/bin/sh # Reject files over 1 MB in size find . -type f -size +1M -exec echo "File too large: {}" \; -exec exit 1 \;`

#### 2. **Commit-msg Hook**

The `commit-msg` hook runs after the commit message is entered, but before the commit is finalized. This hook is useful for enforcing commit message conventions (e.g., requiring a specific format).

- **Use case**: Enforcing commit message format (e.g., "JIRA-123: Fixed bug in authentication").
- **Example**: Ensuring that commit messages follow a specific patter

`#!/bin/sh # Ensure commit messages start with a ticket number if ! grep -qE "^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+: " "$1"; then   echo "Commit message must start with a ticket number (e.g., 'PROJ-123:')"   exit 1 fi`

#### 3. **Pre-push Hook**

The `pre-push` hook runs before a push to a remote repository. It allows you to check the state of your local repository or perform tasks such as running tests to make sure everything is working properly before pushing.

- **Use case**: Running unit tests, checking for code coverage, or ensuring that the branch is up to date with the remote.
- **Example**: Preventing pushes if unit tests fai

`#!/bin/sh # Run tests before pushing npm test || exit 1`

#### 4. **Post-commit Hook**

The `post-commit` hook runs immediately after a commit is made. This hook is useful for tasks such as notifying a team, logging commits, or triggering other scripts after a successful commit.

- **Use case**: Sending notifications, updating build systems, or logging commit details.
- **Example**: Sending a Slack notification after each commi

`#!/bin/sh # Send a message to Slack after each commit curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"New commit made!"}' https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/XXX/XXX`

#### 5. **Pre-merge-commit Hook**

The `pre-merge-commit` hook runs before a merge commit is created. This is particularly useful for ensuring that code meets certain criteria before it is merged into the branch.

- **Use case**: Running tests or checking for conflicts before merging.
- **Example**: Rejecting the merge if there are failing test

`#!/bin/sh # Run tests before merging npm test || exit 1`

#### 6. **Post-checkout Hook**

The `post-checkout` hook runs after switching branches (e.g., after executing `git checkout`). It can be used to automate tasks related to the checkout process, such as setting up environment variables or installing dependencies.

- **Use case**: Installing dependencies when switching branches.
- **Example**: Automatically running `npm install` when switching branche

`#!/bin/sh # Install dependencies after switching branches npm install`

### How to Use Git Hooks

Git hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory inside your repository. By default, Git provides example scripts that are commented out. To enable a hook, you’ll need to create a new executable script file (or modify the existing one) in the `.git/hooks` directory.

#### Steps to Set Up a Git Hook:

1. Navigate to your repository's `.git/hooks` directory:
    
    
    `cd .git/hooks`
    
2. Find the hook you want to enable, for example, `pre-commit.sample`. Rename it by removing the `.sample` extension:
    
    
    `mv pre-commit.sample pre-commit`
    
3. Edit the hook script with your custom logic using any text editor:
    
    
    `nano pre-commit`
    
4. Make sure the script is executable:
    
    
    `chmod +x pre-commit`
    
5. After editing the script, Git will automatically execute it at the appropriate time in the Git workflow (e.g., before committing, before pushing, etc.).

### Server-Side Hooks

Server-side hooks are used in Git repositories on the server (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to enforce policies, such as rejecting certain commits or requiring specific actions before pushing.

Common server-side hooks include:

- **pre-receive**: Runs before any changes are received by the server. It can be used for authentication or to enforce rules on incoming commits.
- **update**: Similar to `pre-receive`, but runs on each branch separately.
- **post-receive**: Runs after changes have been accepted by the server. It can be used for notifications, deployments, etc.

Server-side hooks require administrative access to the Git server and are typically used in a team or collaborative environment to enforce repository policies.

### Managing and Sharing Git Hooks

By default, Git hooks are local to your repository and not shared with others when you clone or push your repository. However, there are ways to share and manage hooks within a team:

1. **Git Hook Manager**: Tools like [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) can help automate the management of Git hooks in a consistent manner across your team. Husky makes it easy to add, configure, and share hooks for various tasks such as linting, testing, and formatting.
    
2. **Version Control for Hooks**: You can create a `hooks` directory within your project and version-control your custom hooks. Then, you can set up symbolic links to point to the actual Git hooks folder. However, this requires some additional configuration to ensure that the hooks are set up correctly across all team members.

### Example: Enforcing a Pre-commit Hook for Code Linting

To ensure that all code committed to your repository adheres to a consistent style, you can use a pre-commit hook to run a linter before each commit. Here's an example using **ESLint** for JavaScript projects.

1. Install ESLint:
    
    
    `npm install eslint --save-dev`
    
2. Set up the `pre-commit` hook:
    
    
    `# .git/hooks/pre-commit #!/bin/sh # Run ESLint before commit npm run lint || exit 1`
    
3. Make the script executable:
    
    
    `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
    
4. Now, every time someone tries to commit, the `pre-commit` hook will run `npm run lint`. If any linting errors are found, the commit will be rejected.

### Conclusion

Git hooks are a powerful feature that allow you to automate tasks and enforce rules within your Git workflow. Whether it's ensuring code quality before a commit, running tests before pushing changes, or automating deployment after a successful commit, Git hooks can save time and reduce errors.

- **Pre-commit** hooks can automate tasks before commits, such as linting or checking file sizes.
- **Commit-msg** hooks can enforce commit message formats.
- **Pre-push** hooks can run tests or check branch status before pushing.
- **Post-commit** and **post-checkout** hooks can automate actions like notifications or dependency installation.

By integrating hooks into your workflow, you can streamline your development process, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across your team.
