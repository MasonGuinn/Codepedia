Sometimes while working in Git, you may find yourself in situations where you need to temporarily set aside changes or undo them altogether. **Git Stash** and **undoing changes** are valuable tools for these scenarios. This lesson will guide you through how to use these tools to manage your changes effectively and correct mistakes in your Git workflow.

### Git Stash

The **stash** command allows you to save your uncommitted changes temporarily, so you can work on something else without committing the changes. It’s especially useful when you're in the middle of working on a task but need to switch to a different branch without losing your progress.

#### Stashing Your Changes

To stash your changes, run: `git stash` This will:
- Save your changes (both staged and un-staged) to a stack.
- Revert the working directory to the last commit (your changes are temporarily "removed").

#### Viewing Stashed Changes

You can view the list of stashed changes by running: `git stash list` This will show all the stashes you've created, listed by name (e.g., `stash@{0}`, `stash@{1}`, etc.).

#### Applying Stashed Changes

To apply the most recent stash back to your working directory, use: `git stash apply` This will apply the changes but will **not** remove the stash from the list. If you want to remove the stash after applying it, run: `git stash pop` This applies the changes and removes the stash from the list.

#### Applying a Specific Stash

If you have multiple stashes and want to apply one that isn’t the most recent, use: `git stash apply stash@{n}` Where `n` is the stash number you want to apply (e.g., `stash@{0}`, `stash@{1}`, etc.).

#### Deleting Stashes

Once you're done with a stash and no longer need it, delete it using: `git stash drop stash@{n}` To delete all stashes at once, use: `git stash clear`

#### When to Use Stashing

- **When switching branches:** If you're in the middle of changes but need to switch to a different branch quickly, stash your work to come back to it later.
- **To try something experimental:** If you want to experiment with a change but aren’t sure if it’ll work, stash your current progress first.
- **To handle distractions:** If you’re interrupted while working on a task but need to temporarily switch to another task, stashing allows you to save your place and return to it later.

### Undoing Changes in Git

Git also allows you to undo changes that you’ve made to your working directory or staged files. Here are some methods for undoing changes.

#### Undoing Unstaged Changes

If you’ve made changes to a file but haven't staged them yet, you can undo them with: `git checkout -- <file-name>` This will discard any changes in the specified file and restore it to the last committed version.

#### Undoing Staged Changes

If you’ve staged a file (using `git add`) but haven’t committed it yet, you can unstage it with: `git reset <file-name>` This will remove the file from the staging area but leave your changes intact in the working directory.

#### Undoing the Last Commit

If you’ve committed changes but want to undo the last commit (without losing your changes), use: `git reset --soft HEAD~1` This command undoes the last commit and moves the changes back to the staging area. If you want to undo the last commit and remove the changes from the staging area (but not from your working directory), use: `git reset --mixed HEAD~1` If you want to undo the last commit and discard the changes entirely, use: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` **Caution:** The `--hard` option will permanently discard your changes, so use it carefully.

#### Reverting a Commit

If you want to undo a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repository (and don't want to rewrite history), use the `git revert` command: `git revert <commit-hash>` This creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit. This is a safe way to undo changes that have already been shared with others.

### Best Practices for Stashing and Undoing Changes

1. **Use stashing for temporary work interruptions:** If you’re interrupted or need to temporarily switch tasks, stash your changes instead of committing them prematurely.
2. **Avoid using `git reset --hard` casually:** The `--hard` reset discards changes permanently, so use it only when you're absolutely sure you want to throw away local changes.
3. **Revert commits in public branches:** If you need to undo a commit that’s already been pushed to a remote repository, always use `git revert` instead of `git reset` to avoid rewriting history.
4. **Keep a clean working directory:** Frequently stash or commit your changes to avoid losing work. Regular commits help you stay organized and provide a clear history.

### Stashing and Undoing Changes Recap

- **Git stash** is a temporary storage mechanism that lets you save changes without committing them, allowing you to switch tasks or experiment freely.
- **Undoing changes** with `git checkout`, `git reset`, or `git revert` lets you safely discard or modify your changes, whether they are staged, unstaged, or committed.
- **Best practices** for stashing and undoing changes include using stashing for interruptions and avoiding hard resets unless necessary to prevent losing important work.

Mastering these tools allows you to work more flexibly, prevent mistakes, and maintain a clean and manageable Git history.
