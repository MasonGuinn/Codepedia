A final observation before we leave temperature conversion forever. It's bad practice to bury "magic numbers" like 300 and 20 in a program; they convey little information to someone who might have to read the program later, and they are hard to change in a systematic way. Fortunately, C provides a way to avoid such magic numbers. With the `#define` construction, at the beginning of a program you can define a _symbolic name_ or _symbolic constant_ to be a particular string of characters. Thereafter, the compiler will replace all unquoted occurrences of the name by the corresponding string. The replacement for the name can actually be any text at all; it is not limited to numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define LOWER 0 /* lower limit of table */
#define UPPER 300 /* upper limit */
#define STEP 20 /* step size */

main() /* Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
{
    int fahr;

    for (fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP)
        printf("%4d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
}
```

> [!WARNING] The `#define` have to start in the first column 

The quantities LOWER, UPPER and STEP are constants, so they do not appear in declarations. Symbolic names are commonly written in upper case so they can be readily distinguished from lower case variable names. Notice that there is no semicolon at the end of a definition. Since the whole line after the defined name is substituted, there would be too many semicolons in the `for`.
