### Research Methodologies

#### **Qualitative Research**
- **Ethnography**: In-depth study of people and cultures through firsthand observation, participation, and interviews.
- **Participant Observation**: Researcher immerses themselves in a community to observe behaviors and interactions.
- **Interviews**: Structured or unstructured conversations to gather detailed information.
- **Meta-Analysis**: Combining data from multiple studies to identify patterns.
#### **Quantitative Research**
- **Surveys**: Standardized questionnaires with closed or open-ended questions to collect data on behaviors and opinions.
- **Experiments**: Controlled studies simulating real-world scenarios to test hypotheses.
- **Comparative Research**: Analyzing differences and similarities across cultures or societies.​

### Notable Studies & Ethical Considerations

#### **Stanford Prison Experiment (1971)**

- **Overview**: Conducted by Philip Zimbardo to examine the psychological effects of perceived power. College students were assigned roles of guards or prisoners in a simulated prison environment.
    
- **Outcome**: The study was terminated after six days due to participants exhibiting extreme stress and abusive behaviors.
    
- **Ethical Issues**:
    - Lack of informed consent regarding the potential psychological impact.
    - Participants were not adequately protected from harm.
    - Zimbardo's dual role as researcher and prison superintendent compromised objectivity.​

#### **Tearoom Trade Study (1970)**
- **Overview**: Laud Humphreys studied anonymous sexual encounters between men in public restrooms, known as "tearooms."
    
- **Methodology**:
    - Humphreys misrepresented his identity to participants.
    - Recorded license plate numbers to track individuals without consent.
    - Obtained personal information under false pretenses.
        
- **Ethical Issues**:
    - Violation of privacy and lack of informed consent.
    - Deception and potential harm to participants' reputations.

### Research Ethics Principle
- **Respect for Persons**: Acknowledging the autonomy and dignity of participants.
- **Beneficence**: Maximizing benefits while minimizing potential harm.
- **Justice**: Ensuring fair distribution of research benefits and burdens.
- **Informed Consent**: Participants must be fully informed about the study and voluntarily agree to participate.
- **Institutional Review Board (IRB)**: A committee that reviews research proposals to ensure ethical standards are met.​

### Key Concepts
- **Sociology as a Science**: A social science that relies on systematic methods to study human behavior and societies.
- **Empirical Investigation**: Gathering data through direct observation or experimentation to test hypotheses.
- **Hawthorne Effect**: The alteration of behavior by study participants due to their awareness of being observed.
- **Obedience & Diffusion of Responsibility**: Individuals may comply with authority or assume others will take action, leading to ethical lapses.

### Research Quiz Review
1. **Bias**: Researchers should strive to remain objective and free from personal biases.
2. **Survey**: A method of collecting data through questionnaires to understand behaviors and opinions.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: Information obtained through observation or experimentation.
4. **Hawthorne Effect**: Changes in participant behavior due to awareness of being observed.
5. **Challenges in Sociological Experiments**: Difficulty in replicating real-world conditions and ethical concerns limit experimental research in sociology.
