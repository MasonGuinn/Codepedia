### Karl Marx's Concept of Alienation

**Alienation**: A condition in which individuals become disconnected from the products of their labor, the labor process, their own essence, and other people. Marx argued that this is a result of the capitalist mode of production.​

Marx identified four types of alienation:
1. **Alienation from the Product of Labor**: Workers do not own or control the products they create, leading to a sense of disconnection from the outcome of their work.​
2. **Alienation from the Process of Labor**: Workers have little control over the production process, performing repetitive tasks that do not allow for creativity or personal input.​
3. **Alienation from the Self**: The work does not allow individuals to express their human potential and creativity, leading to a loss of self and personal fulfillment.​
4. **Alienation from Others**: The competitive nature of capitalism isolates workers from one another, hindering genuine social relationships.​
