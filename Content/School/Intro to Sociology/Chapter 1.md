Why is sociology hard to experiment?
**Hawthorne Effect:** Reactivity in which individuals modify an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed

**Research Process:**
1. Formulate a research question/problem (Why do people sometimes struggle when going to college?)
2. Review the literature (other research that has been done in this area)
3. Formulate the hypothesis (If you are in a community, you're more likely to succeed in your degree)
4. Formulate research design (Can embed into canvas shells, 38 questions, sence of belonging scale, experience students having, and etc)
5. Carry out research (Get responses back)
6. Interpret the findings (Statistics, math, and etc)
7. Report the findings


**Defining the research problem (asking a question)**
- All research starts with the research problem
- An attempt to gather information to solve a puzzle and fill a gap in understanding
- One research project inevitably leads to another - the more you know, the more you don't know
- The problem or question may change throughout the process

**Review all literature on subject**
- What work has previously been done in this area?
- What particular portion of your research question has not been explored?
- Look at what has been done, with what kind of methods... what will work for you?

**Formulate a hypothesis**
- An educated guess about what is going on
- There needs to be a way to test it empirically (factually)

**Selecting a research design**
- Find a way to gather data that is accurate

**Carrying out the research**
- Plan on having to overcome obstacles, like survey error, participant non-completion, issues with access to subjects, and technical difficulties

Interpreting the results
- Working out the implications of the data


Robert Park - Thought students should actually get out and do research. Hit the streets and do **qualitative** work.

William Ogburn - Wanted sociology to be more like the natural sciences. He thought all sociological study should be **quantitative**.
